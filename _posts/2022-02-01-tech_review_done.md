title: "Report Completed"

Our Bitcoin [Technology Review](https://bitcoineverywhere.tech/reports/bitcoin_everywhere_tech.html) report is now complete. Bringing the benefits of Bitcoin to places that lack financial resources, reliable infrastructure, technological education and personal freedoms is a big challenge. We hope this report can capture some of the unique difficulties Bitcoin communities outside of the developed world face. Our goal was also to create a living document that people can directly [contribute](/reports/contributing) to so that this work can evolve as more input is received. With that in mind, we hope more people from more parts of the world will fill out our anonymous [questionnaire](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/lv7VEOuagTz7oA3dEQ2xqITi31cBNB1TiGSXGb7jaQU/), participate in interviews and add to the report directly.

We would like to thank the [Bitcoin Dev Fund](https://hrf.org/devfund) for their [generous gift](https://hrf.org/hrfs-bitcoin-development-fund-announces-375-million-satoshis-across-10-q3-gifts/) which has made this work possible.
