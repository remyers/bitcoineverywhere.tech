title: "Use Cases"

We define here some our terms for use cases of Bitcoin and explore features that could be uniquely useful in developing economies. 

### Exchanges

The most basic use case for Bitcoin is to buy and sell it for local fiat currency. Bitcoin exchanges can be performed in a variety of ways ranging from in person with cash to using an online custodial exchange which operate via bank transfers.

#### In-Person

Bitcoin can be bought or sold in person for cash using various means to settle the transfer. Two parties with mobile bitcoin wallets on their smart phones can perform the transfer by the bitcoin buyer giving their payment address to the seller. The address can be scanned via a QR code, shared via an SMS message or other similar means. Counter parties can find each other and arrange trades using web sites, at organized [trading events](https://www.meetup.com/stockholm-satoshi-square/) or visit a [retail exchange business](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walk-in-cryptocurrency-exchanges-emerge-amid-bitcoin-boom-11633107697) or bitcoin ATM.

Some disadvantages of in-person transfers include: settlement time, theft and convience. Settlement time for bitcoin transfers is hard to predict. Because of the probabilistic nature of finding blocks even transactions paying high fees might take up to an hour to clear. There is also risks of [assault](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md) when doing in-person transfers involving cash and bitcoin with unknown counter parties. Online trading is more convient than in-person trading, but only for those who already have access to online banking options.

In person trades could once be coordinated with the popular website [localbitcoin.com](https://localbitcoins.com), but regulatory pressure has forced this option to be [removed](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/localbitcoins-stops-cash-trades-personal-offers-on-platform).

#### Person-to-Person (P2P)

Bitcoin can be bought and sold directly with other people using online web sites or applications. These systems host a bulletin board where users post advertisements to buy or sell bitcoin for various forms of payment. Payment can be in the form of a bank transfer, pre-paid gift cards and other online payment methods.

#### Non-Custodial

P2P trading sites like [Localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com) and [Paxful.com](https://paxful.com) hold your bitcoin in a wallet inwhich you do not control the private key that secures your bitcoin. This simplifies trading and security, but means that users do not have ultimate control of their bitcoin waiting to be traded. Non-custodial options like [Hodlhodl.com](https://hodlhodl.com) and [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) only lock bitcoin that is part of a trade into a multisig output. Bitcoin not involved in a trade on these platforms is controlled by keys that are only held by the user. Trades require settlement of both the bitcoin and payment method to be final which can introduce delay. Some payment methods may also be reversible so caution is required when accepting P2P trades offers.

#### Custodial

Custodial trading platforms, like traditional stock trading platforms, host an order book and require users to deposited bitcoin and currencies used for payment. These platforms typically require users submit personally identifying information (PII) to confirm to local regulations. Trades can settle quickly because the platform controls both means of payment. Users must trust custodial platforms to secure their bitcoin and PII from theft. Custodial exchanges can also manipulate their order book using [wash trading](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3362153) and other methods.

#### Over-the-Counter (OTC)

An OTC exchange uses a broker to execute a high value order across various exchanges. Like custodial exchanges an OTC desk will require PII and a deposit in advance of bitcoin to be sold or payment method to be used for a bitcoin purchase.

#### Alt. Coins

Most exchanges also deal in non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies. Used as a payment method, these alternate coins may allow users without traditional means of payment to conduct trades. However, exchanges that trade alt. coins risk misleading new users to assume they hold the same decentralization and value properties as bitcoin.
